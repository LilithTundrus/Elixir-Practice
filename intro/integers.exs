# Integer literals in Elixir can be written as decimal (1234),
# hexadecimal (0xcafe), octal (0o765),
# and binary (0b1010)
#
# Decimal numbers may contain underscoresâ€”these are often used
# to separate groups of three digits when writing large numbers,
# so one million could be written 1_000_000
#
# There is no fixed limit on the size of integers
#
