# Atoms are constants that represent somethingâ€™s name.
# We write them using a leading colon (:), which can be followed by an
# atom word or an Elixir operator. An atom word is a sequence of letters,
# digits, underscores, and at signs (@). It may end with an exclamation
# point or a question mark. You can also create atoms containing arbitrary
# characters by enclosing the characters following the colon in double quotes.
